# Real-Estate-Database
This was a collaboration project to create a database for a potential real estate company. 
This includes a .sql file of the relational database with queries saved as views. 
Our goal in designing the database was to have ultimate functionality, and we achieved this by spending enough time understanding the business entity relationships, as well as making sure the primary and foreign key pathways were accurate to the business.
